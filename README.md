# What is this?
## In progress
- Tungsten aims to be an implementation of the [Wolfram Language](reference.wolfram.com/language/)
- big.js is a copy of [MikeMcl](https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js)'s big.js, very slightly modified
- automaton shows automata on a HTML `canvas` element. Currently only supports Moore neighborhood
- dotNET aims to provide functions with .NET-style syntax, to make porting .NET projects to JS easier (if anyone even does that)
- Python provides common python functions (mainly just to see how similar JS can be to Python)
- stdlib provides random functions, much like underscore/lodash
- uilib aims to provide various functions to help in designing a UI (including a Window, Toolbar and Tabbar (the latter two are unfinished))
- fractal draws fractals on a `canvas` (Currently only supports the [Sierpinski n-flake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-flake) and [Vicsek fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-flake#Vicsek_fractal) via the chaos game method)

## Barely started, progress paused
- retheme aims to be an easy-to-use, optimizing WYSIWYG CSS designer
- brainfuck aims to be a fast Brainfuck optimizer/interpreter
- golfed, libgolf and PPCG provide various random common functions used in golfing
- MATLAB aims to provide common MATLAB functions

# Setup

Download [ace](https://ace.c9.io/) and [tinymce](https://www.tinymce.com/) into `Resources/ace` and `Resources/mce` respectively.

Download jQuery, underscore and MathJax and put them in the main directory, without version numbers.
